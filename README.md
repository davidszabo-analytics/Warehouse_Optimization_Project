# Warehouse_Optimization_Project
SQL-based analysis of pallet dwell-time and labor latency in high-volume logistics.

Identifying bottlenecks in the physical data-stream (warehouse floor) to optimize retrieval paths and developing a relational model to track pallet “dwell-time” from inbound delivery to storage.

Developing a logical framework for Dynamic Labor Allocation. Analysing the delta between "Deadline Completion" and "Labor Hours" in Receiving. Identifying how "Target Rates" can actuate artificial slowdowns, proposing a data-driven "Switch Point" to transition staff between departments based on real-time inbound volume.
